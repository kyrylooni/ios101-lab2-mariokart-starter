# Project 2 - Mario Kart Power-Up Lab

Submitted by: **Kyrylo Onishchenko**

## Overview

This project demonstrates foundational iOS development concepts using Swift, including optionals, type casting, and view transformations. Users interact with a Mario Kart-style interface that responds to taps and customizable settings for kart behavior.

## Features Implemented

âœ… **Optional Handling**  
- User can print a message when the optional value from the `MushroomGenerator` is non-nil.

âœ… **Conditional Power-Up Usage**  
- User can apply a mushroom power-up to Mario only if a valid power-up exists.

âœ… **Mystery Box Deciphering**  
- User can decipher a mystery box using optional type casting and apply the correct effect: `translate`, `rotate`, or `scale`.

âœ… **Dynamic Kart Display**  
- User can control how many karts are shown on screen based on the number selected in settings.

âœ… **Adjustable Kart Size**  
- User can scale the kart size using a setting-controlled multiplier.

âœ… **Customizable Speed**  
- User can adjust kart speed using a setting that modifies the animation speed dynamically.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Safe unwrapping of optionals with `if let` and `guard let`
- Type casting with `as?` and `as!`
- Use of `Any` and `AnyObject` types in Swift
- Dynamic UI transformations with `CGAffineTransform`
- UIKit interaction through IBAction and gesture recognition
- Settings application using dictionary-based configuration
